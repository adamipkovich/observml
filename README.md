# Welcome to ObServML!

## Why use ObServML

This package was created to be able to properly monitor processes, while also having access to an easy set-up with state-of-the-art AI and infrastructure tools. The idea is to provide a simple set of microservices that:

- Has process mining, fault detection, fault isolation and time series analysis tools (not only) for predictive maintenance
- Has integrated MLOps, tracking and regsitry
- Has parallelization and easy-to-use deployment of models - while not being burdened by the extensive costs of Kubernetes
- Includes functionality configuration-based model behavior for simpler interaction.
- LLM based dependency management and docker building
- LLM-based SQL and data formatting
- Can connect to a postgresql database 



## Features

### Celery and FastAPI service

### MLflow

### RabbitMQ for message brokering (continous prediction and)



### Plug-in architecture for monitoring processes


### Model plugins
